- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BilbroReaper, I'm an older dude that spent roughly half my life swinging a hammer. Spent the last decade as a CAD designer in the Oil & Gas industry as well as Telecommunications. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m always interested in learning new things and that is why I am here. Too many subjects to list but if I were to choose one it would have to be Android Security / Pen Testing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting familiar with navigating thru GitHub.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to email me via samaels.bane@proton.me as Im always eager to pick your brain on various topics.
